# shoppingList

This is a simple app develop with HTML, CSS and Javascript. This app keep track of shopping list. It has to main functions namely:-

- **Add** shopping list item by filling the add item form
- **Delete** list item by removing clicking the done button of that item.

This app is part of the weekly task carried out during week three of the women techsters fellowship program. In it, considerations are made on how best to update the DOM. Rather than deleting every list item already rendered, the list items from the point of deletion to the end are removed. Then the items are rerendered from that point.
